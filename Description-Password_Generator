# Password_Generator
The program is a command-line password generator that takes user input for password length and character types, and then creates a secure, random password.


When prompted for the password length, you could enter 8.
For "Include letters?", you could enter yes.
For "Include numbers?", you could enter yes.
For "Include symbols?", you could enter no.

This sequence of inputs would generate a 8-character password containing only letters and numbers.
